GITHUB-IS-NOT-MY-RESUME
=======================

Please don't judge my tech skills or coding chops by what's here.  This is literally a storage closet at best, and at worst, a dumpster.  A dumpster I don't (currently) curate to impress others.

Often, I'll dump text or quick-and-dirty stuff here to share with others, or so I can find it again later.

More often, I'll have super-useful (to me) stuff that also includes sensitive IP addresses, hostnames, keys, etc... so I host those git repos elsewhere, privately.

A person's github commit history stats aren't like a fitbit-for-are-you-a-hacker (at least mine aren't.)

My resume, in fact, *is* here on github, formatted in markdown in a private repo.  Ask, and I may send you a copy.
